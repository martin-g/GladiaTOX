# Introduction

GladiaTOX is an open-source solution for HCS data processing and reporting that expands the tcpl package (toxcast pipeline, *Filer et al., 2016*). In addition to tcpl's functionalities (multiple dose-response fitting and best fit selection), GladiaTOX

- Fetches raw image quantifications via a webservice layer, also allowing multiple (proprietary) systems to be integrated easily
- Computes minimal effective concentrations based also on historical data
- Exports results formatted for ToxPI GUI
- Compute exposure severity scores
- Implements a suite of functionalities for quality control and processing reporting

## Deployed database
The GladiaTOX installation includes the deployment of a sqlite database (`sql/gladiatoxdb.sqlite` folder). The database already contains fully processed study, with

- asid: 1 (assay source id), the unique study identifier
- asnm: StudyI (assay source name), the names of the study
- asph: PhaseI (assay source phase), the study phase

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(GladiaTOX)
# Set output directory for reporting
outdir <- getwd()
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
tcplLoadAsid()
```

This database will be used in next sections to load and process a second study phase. The sqlite database can be seen as a sample database used for the following example In case you plan to use the package for multiple studies we recommend to install the MySQL database (`sql/gladiatoxdb_structure.mysql`).

## Database configuration
The first step after database deployment is to configuration access parameters. The default configuration already points to the sqlite database at 
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
file.path("/install_dir", "sql", "gladiatoxdb.sqlite")
```
so no additional configurations are needed to complete the example below.

In case you install the database schema or change location of the sqlite database, then you must run the configuration command below and point to the new database location. The following command assumes the new database is installed at `my_folder_path`
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
tcplConf(drvr = "SQLite",
         host = NA,
         user = NA,
         pass = NULL,
         db = "/my_folder_path/gladiatoxdb.sqlite")
```
In case you deploy the database schema provided in the sql folder, then change the driver (drvr) to `MySQL`. Eventually you may need to configure your user name and password.

Below is an example of configuration call pointing to an MySQL database called `my_gl_database` at `local.host`:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
tcplConf(drvr = "MySQL",
         host = "local.host",
         user = "username",
         pass = "********",
         db = "my_gl_database")
```

# Data and metadata for vignette
In this section we will explore one simple way for loading data in the database. The following chunks prepare the metadata and data in R objects (data.frame) prior database loading.

The following commands loads the data for vignette, and set the output directory, `outdir`, to the working directory. Change it accordingly to the folder path where your reports have to be saved.
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
load(system.file("extdata", "data_for_vignette.rda", package="GladiaTOX"))
outdir <- getwd()
```
The command loads three objects in the environment. These objects are what users need to prepare before study data can be loaded.

## `plate`: plate metadata
The `plate` object stores metadata with plate information.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(plate)
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
print(head(plate), row.names = FALSE)
```

Most of the columns have self-contained names and content; `plate` is the plate number (usually an integer); `tube` is the well location (H1 is row 8 column 1); `well_type` is the content type of the well (`c` positive control, `t` treatment, `n` is the negative control); `enpoint` contains assay names with no exposure duration info appended; `u_boxtrack` is a plate identifier used to join the `plate` metadata table with the raw data table prior data is loaded in the GladiaTOX database.

## `chnmap`: assay metadata and channel mapping
The second metadata table contains assay mapping information. In the example below two assays are shown: *Cytotoxicity (TIER1)* and *DNA damage (pH2AX)*.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(chnmap, 7)
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
print(head(chnmap, 7), row.names = FALSE)
```
Five endpoints are part of the cytotoxicity assay (e.g., *Cell count*, *membrane permeability*). Two endpoints are shown to be part of the DNA damage assay. Since multiple endpoints can be read from the same plate, each of them is read on a separate channel. This column will also be used later on to join meatadata and data tables).

The content of `plate` and `chnmap` are then combined to generate the `assay` table. In the `assay` table, assay and endpoint are concatenated to timepoints to generate assays entries for the database.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
assay <- GladiaTOX:::.buildAssayTab(plate, chnmap)
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
head(assay, 4)
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
print(head(assay, 4), row.names = FALSE)
```
## `dat`: image quantification raw data
The data table is an export from the image quantification instrument.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(dat)
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
print(head(dat), row.names = FALSE)
```
This table contains the raw fluorescence quantification values: `measure_val`; `rowi` and `coli` are the row and column indexes; `machine_name` is the channel name and is used to join this table with the assay table above; `u_boxtrack` is the plate identified and is used to join the table with the plate table.

# Database loading
In this sections data and metadata will be loaded in the GladiaTOX database. Let's set the study parameters, study name and phase of the new study phase to be loaded in the database and processed.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
## Set study parameters
std.nm <- "SampleStudy" # study name
phs.nm <- "PhaseII" # study phase
```

## Register study info in database
The following code will register metadata file content in the database, including: assays, endpoint, treatments and controls. The status of the assay source table (study table) before and after new study creation is displayed below.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## List of studies before loading
tcplLoadAsid()
## Load annotation in gtoxDB
loadAnnot(plate, assay, NULL)
## List of studies after loading
tcplLoadAsid()
```
The `loadAnnot` function call registers multiple study parameters in the database, including the creation of the new assay source id (asid). The asid identifies the pair study name, study phase. The asid is what will be used to load raw data of the study, process the study and generate reports.

## Load raw data in database
The `asid` just created can be retrieved by querying the database and specify the study name and phase.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Get assay source ID
asid = tcplLoadAsid(fld = c("asnm", "asph"), val = list(std.nm, phs.nm))$asid
print(asid)
```
The `asid` and the `dat` objects are the inputs to the `prepareDatForDB` function used to join metadata stored in database to the raw data stored in the `dat` object.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Prepare and load data
dat <- GladiaTOX:::.prepareDatForDB(asid, dat)
tcplWriteData(dat[ , list(acid, waid, wllq, rval)], lvl = 0, type = "mc")
```
Then the raw data is loaded in the database with the `tcplWriteData` function. Study whose `asid` is `2` is now ready to be processed.

# Quality control: data processing and reporting
Metadata and data are now registered in the database. Next step is to select the processing methods we want to apply on the data. There are multiple levels of processing (see `tcplMthdLoad(lvl=3)` foe details). The fucntion `assignDefaultMthds` is a shortcut to assign all levels methods at once. The methods selected would probably fit well to most users.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
assignDefaultMthds(asid = asid)
```
With the default selection, raw data is normalized by computing the log2 fold change of values in each well against the median of the corresponding controls.

## Compute the noise band
The package computes a noise band to discriminate concentration series that are active versus those that are not. The default behaviour is to compute noise band margins separately for each endpoint. Margins correspond to 3 times the baseline median absolute deviation of vehicle responses. The following code computes the cutoffs and store them in the database.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res <- tcplRun(asid = asid, slvl = 1, elvl = 3, mc.cores = 2)
aeids <- tcplLoadAeid(fld = "asid", val = asid)$aeid
tmp <- mapply(function(xx){
tryCatch(gtoxCalcVmad(inputs = xx, aeid = xx, 
notes = "computed within study"), 
error = function(e) NULL)},
as.integer(aeids))
res <- tcplRun(asid = asid, slvl = 1, elvl = 6, mc.cores = 2)
```
In the original work (*Filer et al., 2016*), the default behaviour is to compute noise band margins based on the response of the lowest two concentrations of the series. That assumes that no response is observed at those concentrations. The current package overcome that assumption and extend the list of functionalities. The database design was modified accordingly.

## Quality control report
Quality control is the mean to check the quality of the data produced in the lab. Each experimental plate is controlled. Plates not passing the control step are filtered out. Quality control is commonly based on a visual inspection. The package exposes functionalities to generate a self contained pdf file with plate heatmaps and positive control plots.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
## QC report
gtoxReport(type = "qc", asid = asid, report_author = "report author",
report_title = "Vignette QC report", odir = outdir)
```
An example of plate heatmap is shown below, and is what included in the quality control pdf report.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
acnm <- "DNA damage (pH2AX)_DNA damage (pH2AX)_4h"
myaid <- gtoxLoadApid()[u_boxtrack == "S-000031351", aid]
myaid <- myaid[myaid%in%tcplLoadAid(fld = "asid", val = asid)$aid]
apid <- gtoxLoadApid()[u_boxtrack == "S-000031351" & aid == myaid, apid]
acid <- tcplLoadAcid(fld = c("aid", "acnm"), val = list(myaid, acnm))[, acid]
l2 <- tcplLoadData(lvl = 2L, fld = "acid", val = acid)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig=TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Example of heatmap of a plate raw values. Letters in well indicate the well type.'}
tcplPlotPlate(dat = l2, apid = apid, id = acid)
```

The QC report includes also dose-responses for positive control chemicals as in figure.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
aeid <- tcplLoadAeid(fld = c("acid", "analysis_direction"), val = list(acid, "up"))[, aeid]
spid <- gtoxLoadWaid(fld = c("apid", "wllt"), val = list(apid, "c"))[,unique(spid)]
m4id <- tcplLoadData(lvl = 4L, fld = c("spid", "aeid"), val = list(spid, aeid))[, m4id]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=8, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Example of Positive control (chlorambucil chemical) plot with three concentrations, and three technical replicates per concentration.'}
tcplPlotM4ID(m4id = m4id, lvl = 6, bline = "coff")
```
The panel on the right side shows a set of information including goodness of fit. In this particular example no info is available since the series has to few concentration to fit a model (4 concentrations is the minimum number to perform a fit).

### Data masking
QC report is mainly used to check the quality of the plates. For example, in case the response of a positive control of an assay stays within the noiseband, then the user may decide to filter that plate out. Below is shown the code to mask plate *S-000030318*.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
apid <- gtoxLoadApid()[u_boxtrack%in%"S-000030318", apid] # plate id
waids <- gtoxLoadWaid(fld="apid", val=apid)$waid #well ids
m0ids <- tcplLoadData(lvl = 0, fld = "waid", val = waids)$m0id # raw data ids
gtoxSetWllq(ids = m0ids, wllq = 0, type = "mc") # set well quality to zero
```
The masked plate will not be processed and will not be included in the final report.

# Data processing and reporting
## Process data
Now that the user has selected the processing methods, cutoffs computed, and bad quality plates masked, all information is in place to start processing the data with the following command.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res <- tcplRun(asid = asid, slvl = 1, elvl = 6, mc.cores = 2)
```
The `tcplRun` returns a list of vectors of logical values used to check processing status. The resulting processed data is automatically stored in the database along with the statistics computed. Statistics include activity concentrations (AC10 and AC50) and minimal effective concentrations (MECs).

## Data reporting
The `gtoxReport` function, with option `type = "all"`, triggers the generation of the full processing report. The pdf file created includes summary tables, dose-response curves (as seen later), and other plots for all chemicals tested in the study.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
## Processing report
gtoxReport(type = "all", asid = asid, report_author = "report author",
report_title = "Vignette Processing report", odir = outdir)
```
Models that best fit the data are also included in the final report. In order to select the best fitting the package evaluate three models: constant, hill and gain-loss. Below is shown an example where all models are fit to the data (ochre, red and blue) from a single plate.

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.width=7}
## Endpoint to plot
aeids <- tcplLoadAeid(fld=c("asid", "aenm"),
val=list(asid, "DNA damage (pH2AX)_DNA damage (pH2AX)_24h_up"),
add.fld="asid")$aeid
## level 4 id to plot
m4id <- tcplLoadData(lvl=4L)[(aeid==aeids & grepl("chromium", spid))]$m4id[1]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=8, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Best fit selection.'}
tcplPlotM4ID(m4id = m4id, lvl = 6, bline = "coff")
```

The HILL model (marked in red on the right panel) will be selected as best fit since minimizing the Akaike information criteria (AIC).

All winning models are combined into a single plot that is included in the pdf report. An example of winning model plot is shown in figure, for the very same chemical and endpoint used above.
```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Example of dose-response curves.'}
## Get chemical id to plot
chid <- tcplLoadChem(field = "chnm", val = "chromium",
include.spid = FALSE)$chid
## Plot dose-response curves
gtoxPlotWin(chid = chid, aeid = aeids, bline = "bmad", collapse = TRUE)
```
The plot shows all replicated dose-response curves. Each curve represents the fitting result on an experimental plate. Only best fits are reported.

# Additional reporting plots
Additional reporting plots, not included in the full report, can be obtained as described below. Boxplot of minimal effective concentrations can be obtained running the following chunk. An example of boxplot is reported below. MEC values are shown as dots. Low MECs correspond to high toxicity.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
fname <- paste0(format(Sys.Date(), format="%y%m%d"), "_ASID", asid,"_MEC.pdf")
fname <- file.path(outdir, fname)
pdf(fname, width = 11, height = 7)
glPlotStat(asid)
dev.off()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Example of MEC barplot.'}
knitr::include_graphics('MECfig.png')
```
The MEC plot shows an example of MEC boxplot. In the example the GSH assay is shown along with the two endpoints (GSH content and Cell count). Chemicals are listed in the legend to the right. Each dot in the plot represents an MEC value.

MEC values can also be reported in a piechart. Below an example.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Example of pie plots. The figure shows three chemicals and all endpoints.'}
chnms <- c("mercury", "o-cresol", "p-cresol")
glPlotPie(asid, chnms = chnms)
```
The pie plot reports the mean MECs for all endpoints measured in the study. Time points are reported to the right (4h, 24h). Each slice is associated to an endpoint. Numbers on the slides indicate the corresponding MEC means.

Severity scores can also be computed and displayed. This score indicate the average impact of chemicals across multiple endpoints.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, dev=c('svg'), fig.cap='Example of severity score plot.'}
glPlotToxInd(asid)
```
Example of severity score plot reporting the full list of chemicals used in the study; y-axis reports the severity score value (normalized between 0 and 1); x-axis in just the index of the chemical.
