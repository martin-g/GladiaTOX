\description{
\code{mc6_mthds} returns a list of flag methods to be used
during level 6 multiple-concentration processing.

\section{Available Methods}{


More information about the level 6 multiple-concentration processing is
available in the package vignette, "Pipeline_Overview."

\describe{
  \item{row.dev.up}{The row.dev.up flag looks at the individual point data,
  searching for row effects across an apid. To get flagged the point has to
  be greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean response for the
  plate, and the row mean must be greater than 3 standard deviations above
  the row means for the plate.}
  \item{row.dev.dn}{The row.dev.dn flag is identical to the row.dev.up flag,
  but identifies points falling in rows with decreased signals.}
  \item{col.dev.up}{The col.dev.up flag is identical to the row.dev.up flag,
  but identifies points falling in columns with increased signals.}
  \item{col.dev.dn}{The col.dev.up flag is identical to the row.dev.up flag,
  but identifies points falling in columns with decreased signals.}
  \item{plate.flare}{The plate.flare flag looks at the individual point data,
  searching for overly active regions across an apid. Intended for use in
  fluorometric assays that are read by a plate-reader that measures the
  plate as a whole, rather than measuring individual wells. For each well
  the flare value is calculated as a weighted mean a 5 well by 5 well box
  centered on the well where the weight given to each well in the box is the
  euclidian distance from the center well. The flag then identifies points
  with flare values greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean flare
  values for the plate.}
  \item{plate.interlace}{The plate.interlace flag is specific to one
  experimental design that plates chemicals from a 386 well chemical plate
  to a 1536 well assay plate. The flag looks for any chemical-plate affects,
  by looking for an increased signal in the wells originating from the same
  chemical plate.}
  \item{rep.mismatch}{The rep.mismatch flag is still in development and is
  not suggested for use at this time.}
  \item{pintool}{Deprecated. The pintool flag uses a complicated algorithm
  to look for signal potentially caused by residual in the pintool used to
  deliver the chemical to assay plates in some experimental designs. The
  gnls.lowconc is a faster and simpler way to identify where this problem
  may be driving the activity or hit-call.}
  \item{singlept.hit.high}{The singlept.hit.high flag identifies
  concentration series where the median response was greater than 3*bmad
  only at the highest tested concentration and the series had an active
  hit-call.}
  \item{singlept.hit.mid}{The singlept.hit.mid flag identifies concentration
  series where the median response was greater than 3*bmad at only one
  concentration (not the highest tested concentration) and the series had
  an active hit-call.}
  \item{multipoint.neg}{The multipoint.neg flag identifies concentration
  series with response medians greater than 3*bmad at multiple
  concentrations and an inactive hit-call.}
  \item{gnls.lowconc}{The gnls.lowconc flag identifies concentration series
  where the gain-loss model won, the gain AC50 is less than the minimum
  tested concentration, and the loss AC50 is less than the mean tested
  concentration.}
  \item{noise}{The noise flag attempts to identify noisy concentration
  series by flagging series where the root mean square error for the series
  is greater than the cutoff for the assay endpoint.}
  \item{border.hit}{The border.hit flag identifies active concentration
  series where the top parameter of the winning model was less than or equal
  to 1.2*cut-off or the the activity probablity was less than 0.9.}
  \item{border.miss}{The border.miss flag identifies inactive concentration
  series where either the Hill or gain-loss top parameter was greater than
  or equal to 0.8*cut-off and the activity probability was greater than 0.5.}
  \item{overfit.hit}{The overfit.hit flag recalculates the model winner
  after applying a small sample correction factor to the AIC values. If the
  hit-call would be changed after applying the small sample correction
  factor the series is flagged. Series with less than 5 concentrations where
  the hill model won and series with less than 7 concentrations where the
  gain-loss model won are automatically flagged.}
  \item{efficacy.50}{The efficacy.50 flag identifies concentration series
  with efficacy values (either the modeled top parameter for the winning
  model or the maximum median response) are less than 50. Intended for use
  with biochemical assays where one might expect at least a 50\% change in
  real responses.}
